# Parkathon

Parkathon is a web application designed to help users find parking spots efficiently. Using user feedback and machine learning, it provides probabilistic predictions for parking availability, making it the perfect parking companion.

## Features

- **Real-time Availability**: Determines parking availability based on nearby users' parking or unparking activities.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Fetches historical parking data from a database and uses a machine learning model to predict future parking availability.
- **User-friendly Interface**: An intuitive frontend to display parking predictions to users through a map.

**Query Parameters**:

- `user`: (number) The unique ID of the user occupying the parking spot.

### POST /park/list/all

**Purpose**: This endpoint is used to return a list of all the parking spots listed by the specified user.

**Query Parameters**:

- `user`: (number) The unique ID of the user occupying the parking spot.

### POST /park/occupy

**Purpose**: This endpoint is used to mark a specific location as occupied by a user.

**Query Parameters**:

- `user`: (number) The unique ID of the user occupying the parking spot.
- `lat`: (number) The latiture of the location.
- `lon`: (number) The longtitute of the location.

### POST /park/vacay

**Purpose**: This endpoint is used to mark a specific parking as vacated by a user.

**Query Parameters**:

- `user`: (number) The unique ID of the user occupying the parking spot.
- `parking`: (number) The unique ID of the parking location that should be marked as vacated.

### POST /park/find

**Purpose**: This endpoint is used to return all the currently empty parking location near a location

**Query Parameters**:

- `lat`: (number) The latiture of the location.
- `lon`: (number) The longtitute of the location.
- `rad`: (number) The radius in meters we want to search.

### POST /predict

**Purpose**: This endpoint is used to predict the availability of parking spots based on the user's coordinates, timestamp, weather, and search radius.

**Query Parameters**:

- `coords`: (string) The coordinates (latitude and longtitude).
- `timestamp`: (string) The timestamp of the request in the format "dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm".
